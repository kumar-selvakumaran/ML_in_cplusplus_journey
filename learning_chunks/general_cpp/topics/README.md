        So, I was trying to install OpenGl, and I couldnt get it to run initially. i was getting the following error. <br><br>
        <code> opengltest.cpp:5:10: fatal error: GL/glut.h: No such file or directory
        #include <GL/glut.h>  // GLUT, includes glu.h and gl.h</code> <br>
        <br>
        So, I tried finding the packages, and seeing why this happening and in the process i learned to following things.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Before this i got opencv to work, and 1 differnce i saw in opencv is that it its files were stored in a differnt location namely : <code> /usr/local/include </code> , where a lot of other packages including OpenGL were stored in <code> /usr/include </code>, in fact, previously when i tried installing boost as well, it was stored in <code> /user/include </code>.
                
            </li>
